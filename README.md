Spot Check #1 May 31, 2018 -- Please recognize this spot check will affect your grade.

Please complete the PROJECT OVERVIEW section. Good use of the DAILY JOURNAL / PROJECT NOTES. Consider detailing what each of you has worked on seperately in this area. Code in GitHub repository needs to be updated more regularly.
Some methods detailed in Mondomo are not actually in your code. (i.e. Keypressed is not part of the main menu class as announced) The level of detail in the METHOD SUMMARY/CREATED CLASSES section is great but where is your MAIN class? Keep this up to date but also ensure you click the circles to indicate which ones are done.  Also, you could drag classes into their inherited classes to organize better but it is alright the way you have it too. Begin to update the flow chart to reflect the items you are working on under the METHOD PLANNING AREA 

You have not linked your Gantt Chart in the PROJECT TIMELINE section.  Gantt chart does not appear to be up to date at all. Many items are behind schedule.  Going forward, I need to see this as it should reflect where you are at on a regular basis. Move items forward if need be.


Level 3+ -- Note: This counts for 3% from the 15% of the summative grade

It does not appear that you made many changes since my last spot check was done.

PROJECT OVERVIEW: (Incomplete).  Missing description of main programming concepts used
DAILY JOURNAL / PROJECT NOTES not being kept upto date.  Missing items worked on for June 1,2,5,6. Please consider detailing what each of you has worked on seperately in this area. Note: Daily notes need to be updated daily.  

Code in GitHub repository needs to be updated more regularly.

METHOD SUMMARY/CREATED CLASSES section is great but where is your MAIN class? Keep this up to date but also ensure you click the circles to indicate which ones are done or nearing completion.  Also, you could drag classes into their inherited classes to organize better but it is alright the way you have it too. 

Begin to update the FLOW CHART to reflect the items you are working on under the METHOD PLANNING AREA 

You have not linked your Gantt Chart in the PROJECT TIMELINE section (i.e. replace the ICS4U URL with your Gantt Chart).  
GANTT CHART does not appear to be up to date at all. Many items are STILL behind schedule.  Going forward, I will need to see this as it should reflect where you are at on a regular basis. Move items forward, backwards or remove if need be.

Level 2 -- Note: This spot check counts for 6% from the 15% of the summative grade
